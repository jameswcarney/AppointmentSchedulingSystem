This project was created to fulfill coursework requirements for my Bachelor of Computer Science degree.

- Basic user login system with notification of appointments in the next 15 minutes.
- Allows create/edit/delete of appointments and customers.
- Created using Java and JavaFX with a DAO design pattern.



## Installation

To protect the academic integrity of my university, I have chosen not to provide the database that enables use of this
project. If you are viewing this as a potential employer, please contact me and I will gladly provide you the working 
database files to enable the program to function, as well as installation instructions.

## Usage

Log in using the following info:

    Username: test
    Password: test

The customers menu shows all customers currently in the database and provides the ability to add, edit, or delete a customer.
Appointments currently in the database can be viewed in the appointments menu, and appointments can also be added/edited/deleted. 
Start and end times are displayed based on your system's region settings. The reports menu displays some general reports related to
current customers, appointments, and employee meeting schedules.
